    Born on 25 January 1985 to a Ukrainian mother and Ukrainian Jewish father in Orotukan, Magadan Oblast, Russian Far East.[1][2] Karol moved to Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine at the age of six. Her father, Grigoriy Liberman was from Vashkivtsi, Ukraine. Karol confessed in 2006 she often felt discriminated against in school because of her Jewish last name.[2] She is fluent in both Ukrainian and Russian. As a teenager Karol (under her real name Tetyana Liberman) performed for four years with the dancing ensemble at the Kyiv branch of the Jewish Agency, and her repertoire included songs in Hebrew and in Yiddish.[2] In 2000 she with this ensemble travelled to the United States, where the group's appearances raised money for Jewish Agency for Israel programs in Ukraine.
